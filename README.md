# Overview #


# Running the code
1. `cd` to `/server` and run `make` to compile the server code. Run this executable to set up the server. It will print its listening port to the console.

2. Run `make` to compile the captain (client) code. This executable expects input of the form
```sh
captain <server address> <server port>
```
where `server address` and `server port` refer to the directory server.
